To analyze **traffic accident data** and identify patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**, we can follow these steps:

---

## **1. Overview**  
The goal is to analyze **US traffic accident data** to identify trends, accident hotspots, and contributing factors such as weather, road conditions, and time of day. The dataset is sourced from:  
[**US Accident EDA - Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda).

## **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- Load the dataset (`US_Accidents.csv`).  
- Handle missing values and standardize data.  
- Convert date-time columns to proper formats.  
- Categorize weather and road condition factors.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyze accident frequency by **time of day (morning, evening, night)**.  
- Identify accident patterns by **weather conditions** (rain, snow, fog).  
- Study the impact of **road conditions** (wet, icy, dry).  
- Examine accident distribution by **location (state/city)**.

## **4. Data Visualization**  
- **Accident Hotspots** using Geospatial Heatmaps.  
- **Time-series trends** of accidents.  
- **Weather & Road Condition Impact** using bar plots.  
- **Accident Severity Analysis** (pie charts, boxplots).  

## **5. Tools & Libraries**  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Folium (for geospatial maps)  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: GeoPandas
